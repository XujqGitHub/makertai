# makertai
Creating and testing an RTAI patched linux kernel.

## The makertaikernel.sh script

For now, see 
http://relacs.sourceforge.net/plugins/rtaicomedi/index.html#quickinstall
for a documentation on how to use the `makertaikernel.sh` scritpt.

Or call
```
./makertaikernel.sh --help
```
for a quick overview.

The python script `testreport.py` summarizes test results. It is meant
as an improvement of the `makertaikernel.sh report` function.

## The test results

In the subfolders you can store test results file generated by
`makertaikernel.sh` (the `latencies-*` files along with the
corresponding kernel configurations `config-*`). That way we can get
an overview on what is possible with RTAI and which hardware has been
used.
